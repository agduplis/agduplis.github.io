                <p>Hello! I'm Abby, and my love for food began in my parents kitchen growing up. My Dad being my biggest influence i was driven by a desire to create meals that were both delicious and genuinely nourishing. I truly belive that food is the ultimate fuel for our bodies, and that healthy eating should never be a compromise on flavor or enjoyment. My journey with foood has taken me through getting my bachelors in Nutrition, wokring in the food industry for 7 years, working with private chefs and now a private chef of my own. </p>
                <p>My philosophy when it comes to food is only the freshest, high-quality ingredients, to fuel the soul. Whether you're a busy professional, an athlete in training, or simply looking to improve your relationship with food, I'm here to make your life easier and more delicious.</p>
